It is a Language Translator. Here, we can translate text in English to Japanese/Chinese and vice versa. We will also be able to upload an image, extract the text and translate it into the desired language. 
The targetted text will also be converted to speech. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been used to create this project. It was deployed with the help of Streamlit.
